# Project Dexterity

## Overview
Dexterity is a capstone project developed by ECE students at the University of Virginia (Class of 2025). The project consists of a robotic hand that can be controlled using a haptic feedback glove, providing a natural and intuitive way to control robotic movements while receiving tactile feedback.

## Project Structure
### Code
- `HapticGlove/` - Firmware for the haptic feedback glove
- `RoboticArm/` - Firmware for the robotic hand control
- `PrototypeGlove/` - Initial prototype implementations
- `ESPNOW/` - ESP-NOW wireless communication implementations
- `test/` - Various test implementations and debugging tools

### PCB
- `Forearm/` - PCB design files for the forearm
- `Hand/` - PCB design files for the hand
- `Library/` - KiCad library files
- `gerber/` - Gerber files for the PCB

## Features
- Real-time finger position tracking
- Haptic feedback system
- Wireless communication between glove and robotic hand
